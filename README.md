# Exam_GPA_DATASET

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Exam Scores and GPA" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of two variables: Exam scores and corresponding GPA (Grade Point Average). Our goal is to explore the relationship between exam performance and GPA.

- Exam: Exam scores achieved by students.
- GPA: Grade Point Average of students.

**Repository Structure**
- Exam_Scores_and_GPA.csv: Contains the raw data file used in the analysis.
- Exam_Scores_and_GPA.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
